*(1)* A sample csv data is given (sample_data.csv). Please note that, unless the user change the script for their specific need at own risk,  the input data should exactly be in the format of sample data provided.

*(2)* User should scientifically fix the "threshold_value" and "standard_value" before executing the script.


**Running python code in terminal:**
You can run the python script (*aph_calculator.py*) in terminal to identify the hotspots.
This script should run with the desired threshold_value and standard value in the same order.

	python aph_calculator.py threshold_value standard_value

	eg: If my threshold value is 67.5 and standard value is 45, i will run the script as follows
	
	python aph_calculator.py 45 67.5
	
	*CAUTION*: Don't run in WRONG order like python aph_calculator.py 67.5 45 (WRONG!!)


**Running Jupyter:**
A jupyter notebook is provided for the same -- *aph_calculator_normal.ipynb*


**Runnig in Google Colaboratory:**
A jupyter notebook that can be used in the Google Colab is also provided for the same -- *aph_calculator_gcolab.ipynb*
